First, all island headers are written to 'sorted-allislands.headers'

Then, run:

python generateNegatives.py sorted-allislands.headers

to get 'negatives.headers' as an output file with random coordinates. 

then run:

python repeatFeatures.py negtives.headers 

to get 'features'

I have created multiple versions of those named negative-features-x

To test, run 

python classify.py positive-features negative-features-x file1 file2 N 

file1 and file2 can be any feature files (my way of creating different versions
to train and test on different data, for these experiments they can be disregarded). 
N is the number of lines in file2.
